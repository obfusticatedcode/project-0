#### Challenges faced



Spending too much time online reviewing other people's code instead of approaching the problem with a plan. Stepping back and having a fresh perspective to the problem, developing a better and more comprehensive plan and design from the get go, had me back on track.
Tackling every problem one at a time is definitely the best approach, compared to trying to solve problems in 'chunks'.

Learning the many different available JavaScript APIs.I've tried to add comments to almost every line of code to allow more understanding.

Trying to figure out the logic to restrict a player to the allotted number of moves as they're multiple jump moves in checkers. This happens to be an on-going puzzle to be solved in future releases.



#### Conclusion
Going forward, I'd like to implement the following:

1. Player change from player 1 to player 2.
2. Have AI and allow the computer to make clever moves.
3. Reset the game by putting the pieces to the original position instead of reload the whole page.
4. Have an animation for the winning player
5. Could do more styling to make the game have a smoother feel.
6. Add some sounds using a sound board for each square; every square should have a unique sound.
